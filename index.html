	<p>This website is good because it is very user-friendly and pleasing to the eye. The color choice is not very good. I recognize plenty of tags but see some unfamiliar ones such as script and iframe. I think script embeds something in the document and iframe helps with organizing the page. This website compared to mine is alot more structured and organized although i think it could use better pictures.</p>
